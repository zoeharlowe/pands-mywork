# nameandage.py
# This program asks the user to input their name and age and then prints them out
# Author:  Zoe McNamara Harlowe

# First I got the user to input their name and age
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = ( input("Enter your age: "))

# Then I was messing with the tab function in the print statement
print('Hello ' + name + '\t, your age is ' + (age) +'.')
